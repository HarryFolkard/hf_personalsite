      IS STUFF ACTUALLY CHANGING? I graduated from Keble College, Oxford, in 2022 having read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.
      Speciallising in Economics, I particularly focussed on more technical Economics papers and am now interested in Economics, Maths, Statistics, Finance, and Computer Science.

        This website began as a personal project primarily as a practical way to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        Given that it would be better with a purpose, however, I have decided to use it to pass on my undergraduate notes - which also required me learning LaTeX - in the hope that they might prove useful to others studying Economics.
        I hope further to use this site as a personal webpage to add projects I am undertaking such as notes and docs I have created for students I tutor, as well as computer science work.
